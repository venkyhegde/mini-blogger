      "body": "Singapore prevailed in a closely-fought, rain-affected match against Qatar to close out a six-run win in their opening match of the second leg of CWC Challenge League A, keeping pace with hosts Canada at the top of the table with five wins from six overall.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Vanuatu started off their tour with only their second win of the competition, again besting Malaysia albeit without captain and lead wicket-taker, Patrick Matautaava, who remains stranded in Denmark along with two Danish players waiting for his visa to clear.\n\nVanuatu nonetheless took advantage of the conditions as Malaysia struggled to put partnerships together on another difficult King City wicket, only a dogged 28 from Virandeep Singh at the top of the order and a battling unbeaten 42 from Khizar Hayat at seven, dragged them to a total of 124.",
